##Study Drill Question

>I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

###It is if you want the ouput to be a floating number. If you just put 4 the ouput will not be a floating number

###Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.
